The Mavka is a creature from Ukrainian mythology, akin to a rusalka, appearing as a beautiful naked girl or maiden dressed in a long white shirt with long flowing green hair. According to folk beliefs, Mavka is the souls of drowned women and girls who died unbaptized, or less commonly, children abducted by the devil. Forests are their usual dwelling places. There was a widespread belief in Mavka dances at so-called \"playgrounds\" â€” areas where no grass grows. Sometimes they were also attributed with planting flowers in the mountains. It was believed that Mavkas could lure boys into thickets to tickle them to death. They also visited people at night, especially women and children, to suck their strength through their breasts."
