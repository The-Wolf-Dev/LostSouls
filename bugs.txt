1.	Slash animation: can be easily reproduced by setting animation duration to 0.6
	and clicking very fast on left mouse button. UPD Fixed

2.	Saves: sometimes when trying to save, something goes wrong and save file remains
	empty. UPD Fixed

3.	When modulate (opacity) was added to Player/Effects/Heal in AnimPlayer, Heal
	changed its color to black
